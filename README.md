# fiea-portfolio-project
My submission for a FIEA portfolio project

None of the files in the external folder were created by the author of this project. See below, also see the comment header at the top of those files.

Third party libraries used:
* SFML - https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.5.1/
* timyxml2 - https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2

"AWE" is the name of the namespace into which I put everything I wrote.
